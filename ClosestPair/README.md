# Closest Pair

This describes an algorithm to compute the closest pair of points in a point-set. 

The algorithm inputs the coordinates of the points in the point-set from a text whose format matches the txt files uploaded, and output:

(1) the coordinates of a closest pair in the point-set.

(2) the distance between the two points in the closest pair.

## The codes file
1. PointsSet: class to store and manipulate a set of points. 

2. ComparatorX: comparator to sort points according to x.

3. ComparatorY: comparator to sort points according to y.

4. ClosestPairTest: test driver to compute the pair of points.
