# Closest Pair

This is the algorithm to compute the closest pair of points in a point-set. 

The algorithm inputs the coordinates of the points in the point-set from a text whose format matches the txt files uploaded, and output:

(1) the coordinates of a closest pair in the point-set.

(2) the distance between the two points in the closest pair.
