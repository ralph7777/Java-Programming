# Infix-to-postfix Expression Calculator

This is a Java application that converts infix expression to postfix expression.

If the infix expression is purely an arithmetic expression, it will evaluate the expression using the postfix evaluation algorithm. 

The implementation contains a Java class Converter, and a method to evaluate the value of a postfix expression.

For simplicity, the format of the input infix expression, each token is separated at least by a space.

For example:

1 + 2 * 3 ^ 4 / 6 ^ 2 

The only operators are binary operators : + - * / ^ (^ represents exponential).
