# Fraction

This is my personal implementation of Fraction Class.

——————————
Noted that:

1. The negative sign is always kept to the numerator, which means the denominator always greater than zero.

2. There is no common factor between numerator and denominator.

3. See attach file to check the detail of Fraction class.
