# JUnit & Javadoc Sample

This example shows the Javadoc and JUnit tests I create for specific classes in the “EC_Project” project.

Each of the 4 classes specified has JUnit tests created and complete Javadoc added to the original source code including class, field, and method comments.

The 4 classes are:

1) Department

2) Employee

3) SalesEmployee

4) Timecard
